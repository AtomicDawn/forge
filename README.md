## Forge

`Forge` is a set of libraries that are designed to make writing a game easier. In some senses it is a game engine. The core library in `Forge` is `Forge.Entities`, which has a novel entity-component-system implementation. There are a number of other libraries which are built around supporting `Forge.Entities` in a game, such as `Forge.Networking`.

## External Libraries

`Forge` builds on top of the fantastic work of other developers. The core 3rd party libraries used are `log4net`, `Lidgren.Network`, and `Newtonsoft.JSON`.
